Pacman Arena
A Pacman clone gone mad

Yes, it's Pacman. With rockets. And bombs. And spoiled gameplay. And in full
3D. Finally, a version of Pacman which will bring your shiny new machine down
to it's knees.


Software requirements:

SDL 1.1 or later
SDL_mixer compiled with Ogg Vorbis support
Hardware-accelerated OpenGL 1.1 implementation

Hardware requirements:

Anything you can tolerate playing this thing on. :)


Compiling this thing might not be straightforward. The makefile is very very
simple, you will likely need to modify it for your system.

Under Windows it's even worse, as the VC project file has absolute paths.

Both of these should be fixed eventually, but right now just grab the binaries
if at all possible.

In addition to the source or binaries you need the data files. Just extract
them in the same directory as the source/binaries and all should be well. (Yes,
this should be fixed too)

Thanks to eviL for all the sound effects and music used in the game.

Enjoy!
